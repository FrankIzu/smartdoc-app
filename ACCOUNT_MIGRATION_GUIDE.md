## Service Account Update for Organization

If you choose organization account, you'll need to:

1. **Create new service account** in the organization's Google Cloud project
2. **Update eas.json** with new service account path
3. **Grant permissions** in Play Console
4. **Test automated submission**

## Files to Update:
- `eas.json` - Update serviceAccountKeyPath
- `PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md` - Update developer name to company
- App store listing - Change from individual to company name

## Timeline Comparison:
- **Individual Account**: 14 days testing + 1-7 days review = 15-21 days
- **Organization Account**: 1-2 days setup + 1-7 days review = 2-9 days

**Recommendation**: Create organization account for faster release and better business positioning.
