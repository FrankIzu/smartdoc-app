| Allowed File Types | ⚠️ Partial | Config exists but not enforced in mobile upload |

**Implementation Required**:
- Network type detection (WiFi vs cellular)
- File size validation before upload in mobile app
- File type validation before upload in mobile app

- Pagination system with configurable page sizes

---

## Privacy & Data Settings

| Setting | Status | Implementation Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Analytics Tracking | ❌ Placeholder | No analytics tracking system implemented |
| Crash Reporting | ❌ Placeholder | No crash reporting system (like Sentry) implemented |
| Usage Statistics | ❌ Placeholder | No usage statistics collection implemented |

**Implementation Required**:
- Analytics system (e.g., Firebase Analytics)
- Crash reporting system (e.g., Sentry)
- Usage statistics collection and reporting

## Current File Upload Validation Status

### What's Working:
- **Upload count limits**: Upload links enforce maximum upload counts
- **File size display**: File sizes are shown in UI
- **Basic file type support**: Most common file types are supported

### What's Missing:
- **File size validation**: 50MB limit is not enforced in mobile uploads
- **File type validation**: Allowed file types are not validated in mobile uploads  
- **WiFi-only uploads**: No network detection or restriction
- **Image compression**: Images are uploaded at full size

### Backend vs Mobile Discrepancy:
- Web app has file size and type validation
- Mobile app lacks these validations
- Configuration exists in `constants/Config.ts` but isn't used

## Priority Implementation Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Functionality):
1. **File Upload Validation**: Implement file size and type validation in mobile uploads
2. **File Preview System**: Add document and image preview capabilities
3. **Grid View**: Implement grid layout for documents

### Medium Priority (User Experience):
1. **Push Notifications**: Basic notification system for file uploads and processing
2. **Image Compression**: Reduce upload sizes and improve performance
3. **WiFi-only Uploads**: Network-aware upload restrictions

### Low Priority (Analytics & Monitoring):
1. **Analytics Tracking**: User behavior and app usage analytics
2. **Crash Reporting**: Error monitoring and crash reports
3. **Usage Statistics**: Anonymous usage data collection

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### File Upload Validation Implementation:
```typescript
// Add to upload functions in mobile app
const validateFile = (file: any, settings: UserPreferences) => {
  // Check file size
  if (file.size > settings.upload_settings.max_file_size_mb * 1024 * 1024) {
    throw new Error(`File too large. Maximum size: ${settings.upload_settings.max_file_size_mb}MB`);
  }
  
  // Check file type
  const extension = file.name.split('.').pop()?.toLowerCase();
  if (!settings.upload_settings.allowed_file_types.includes(extension)) {
    throw new Error(`File type not allowed: ${extension}`);
  }
};
```

### Network Detection Implementation:
```typescript
// Add network detection using expo-network
import * as Network from 'expo-network';

const checkNetworkForUpload = async (wifiOnlyEnabled: boolean) => {
  if (wifiOnlyEnabled) {
    const networkState = await Network.getNetworkStateAsync();
    if (networkState.type !== Network.NetworkStateType.WIFI) {
      throw new Error('WiFi connection required for uploads');
    }
  }
};
```

## Settings UI Improvements

The settings page now includes:
- **Collapsible sections**: Only About and Account sections are expanded by default
- **Implementation status indicators**: 
  - ✓ Green: Fully implemented
  - ◐ Orange: Partially implemented  
  - ○ Gray: Placeholder/not implemented
- **Disabled controls**: Placeholder features are disabled and grayed out
- **Implementation notes**: Explanatory text for non-functional features

This provides transparency to users about which features are currently functional while maintaining a professional appearance.
